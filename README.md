# Online-Shopping-Simulator
Uses Java and Java Swing to emulate an online shopping experience.
Created in June 2017, planning to update soon this year, 2020.

### Objective:
To achieve a fully working program involving all the major concepts covered in a Java course, and to learn how to apply it to something that can be used in everyday life and expand upon it.
To increase my knowledge on the new concepts learned such as I/O, inheritance, arrays, OOP,  and Java Swing GUI.

### User Guide
User browses through a catalogue of items.
When program is first launched, it will default to the 'Home Page'.

####Searching for Items:
The user can search for items in 3 ways. The home screen is set to default to display all the items and the user can scroll through all the items. The second option is to search using the category checkboxes. By clicking on a checkbox, the home screen clears and displays all items under that category. The third option is to use the search bar, located at the very top. The user enters any string and clicks search, to find any item that has that string in its name. If there are no items with a name that matches the string, there will be a pop-up message stating there were no items found.

####Viewing Item Info
Once the user has found their desired item, they may see its information by clicking on the item button. By doing such, a pop-up window is displayed, presenting the item’s name, description, price, and category. On the left is a picture of the item. On the bottom right is an “add to cart” button....

####Adding Items to Cart
If the user is satisfied with what they see, they may click the “Add to Cart” button on the Item information window to add the item to their cart. Once clicked, another pop-up window will display a message stating the item has successfully been added to their cart. 

####Checking Shopping Cart
The user may check their shopping cart at any time by clicking the shopping cart button located on the top right corner of the home page. If there are no items in the shopping cart, a message will be displayed saying there is no items in the shopping cart. If there are items in the shopping cart, there will be a picture of the item, name of item, price of item, and a “remove from cart” button...At the bottom of the shopping cart, there will be a counter for the total number of items there are in the cart, and total price of all items. 

####Removing Items from Cart
If the user wishes to remove an item from cart, they may click the “Remove from Cart” button on the right side of the items displayed in the shopping cart. Doing so will display a message stating that the item has been successfully removed from cart. However, the shopping cart will not automatically update and the user must exit the shopping cart and re-enter it to see the item removed.
